- [Getting Started](#getting-started)

## Getting Started

Before starting with TypeScript, it would be great to know a little bit of JavaScript. The first thing is setting up the TypeScript environment.

### Environment

There are two ways by which a developer can setup the environment, the first one is using the Playground and the next is in the IDE.

#### Playground

Playground can be accessed [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play).

#### IDE*

VS Code can be downloaded from [visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

TypeScript installation command: 

##### Using node

```node
npm install -g typescript
```

##### Using Homebrew

```brew
brew install typescript
```

> Any IDE can be of choice.*
